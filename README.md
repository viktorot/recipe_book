# recipe_book

### Run locally

1. Create a virtual environment to keep everything clean: `python -m venv recipe`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source ./bin/activate`
3. Install Django: `pip install django`
4. Run `make servedev`

If nothing errored out during that, you can navigate to `localhost:8000/welcome/` to test if everthing is working correctly.
